Statistically Separating Tangled Texts

This project experiments with using Simon's Gibrat-style model of text generation to identify contributions to _tangled text._ The leading example of a tangled text is the Bible, which, according to the documentary hypothesis, was redacted from several more fundamental sources in the 6th century BCE. To test our approach, we apply it to _random redactions_ from the Bronte sisters' novels.
